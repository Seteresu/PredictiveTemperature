# PredictiveTemperature
Step 1: Download neccecary components (Juypiterlabs), (python)
Step 2: Create a HiveMQ free account
Step 3: Obtain the MQTT username, password and replace in sketch.io. 
STep 4: Create topics and replace topics in sketch.io
Step 5: Copy sketch.io code and diagram.json code as priovided. 
Step 6: Upon having juypiterlabs successfully downloaded, create a new laucher before saving it. 
Step 7: download the sklearn and pandas
Step 8: make sure temperature2.ipynb's MQTT information is also changed. 
Step 9: Once successful, run Wokwi. If connection, success. W
Step 10: Wait until HiveMQ is operating (must see values via the topics), if successful run the temperature2.ipynb code. 
Step 11: Wait until 20 values, will give results. 
Step 12: Stop code. 

While this code doesn't give statistics charts and graphs, its more than capable of making it so.
